title: " A Topological characterisation of Weisfeiler-Leman equivalence classes "
abstract: " Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are learning models aimed at processing graphs
  and signals on graphs. The most popular and successful GNNs are based on message
  passing schemes. Such schemes inherently have limited expressive power when it comes
  to distinguishing two non-isomorphic graphs. In this article, we rely on the theory
  of covering spaces to fully characterize the classes of graphs that GNNs cannot
  distinguish. We then generate arbitrarily many non-isomorphic graphs that cannot
  be distinguished by GNNs, leading to the GraphCovers dataset. We also show that
  the number of indistinguishable graphs in our dataset grows super-exponentially
  with the number of nodes. Finally, we test the GraphCovers dataset on several GNN
  architectures, showing that none of them can distinguish any two graphs it contains. "
