title: Diversified Multiscale Graph Learning with Graph Self-Correction
abstract: 'Though the multiscale graph learning techniques have enabled advanced feature
  extraction frameworks, we find that the classic ensemble strategy shows inferior
  performance while encountering the high homogeneity of the learnt representation,
  which is caused by the nature of existing graph pooling methods. To cope with this
  issue, we propose a diversified multiscale graph learning model equipped with two
  core ingredients:  a graph self-correction mechanism to generate informative embedded
  graphs, and a diversity boosting regularizer  to achieve a comprehensive characterization
  of the input graph. The proposed mechanism compensates the pooled graph with the
  lost information  during the graph pooling process by  feeding back  the estimated
  residual graph, which serves as a plug-in component for popular graph pooling methods.
  Meanwhile, pooling methods enhanced with the self-correcting procedure encourage
  the discrepancy of node embeddings, and thus it contributes to the success of ensemble
  learning strategy. The proposed regularizer instead enhances the ensemble diversity
  at the graph-level embeddings by leveraging the interaction among individual classifiers.  Extensive
  experiments on popular graph classification benchmarks show that the approaches
  lead to significant improvements over state-of-the-art graph pooling methods, and
  the ensemble multiscale graph learning models achieve superior enhancement.'
