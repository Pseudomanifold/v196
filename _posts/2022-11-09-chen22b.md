title: Local Distance Preserving Auto-encoders using Continuous kNN Graphs
abstract: Auto-encoder models that preserve similarities in the data are a popular
  tool in representation learning.In this paper we introduce several auto-encoder
  models that preserve local distances when mapping from the data space to the  latent
  space.  We use a local distance-preserving loss that is based on the continuous
  k-nearest neighbours graph which is known to capture topological features at all
  scales simultaneously. To improve training performance, we formulate learning as
  a constraint optimisation problem with local distance preservation as the main objective
  and reconstruction accuracy as a constraint. We generalise this approach to hierarchical
  variational auto-encoders thus learning generative models with geometrically consistent
  latent and data spaces.  Our method provides state-of-the-art performance across
  several standard datasets and evaluation metrics.
