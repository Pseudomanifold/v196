title: The Manifold Scattering Transform for High-Dimensional Point Cloud Data
abstract: The manifold scattering transform is a deep feature extractor for data defined
  on a Riemannian manifold. It is one of the first examples of extending convolutional
  neural network-like operators to general manifolds. The initial work on this model
  focused primarily on its theoretical stability and invariance properties but did  not
  provide methods for its numerical implementation except in the case of two-dimensional
  surfaces with predefined meshes. In this work, we present practical schemes,  based
  on the theory of diffusion maps, for implementing the manifold scattering transform
  to datasets arising in naturalistic systems, such as single cell genetics, where
  the data is a high-dimensional point cloud modeled as lying on a low-dimensional
  manifold. We show that our methods are effective for signal classification and manifold
  classification tasks.
