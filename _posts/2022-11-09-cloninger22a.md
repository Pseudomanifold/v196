title: Preface
abstract: The deep learning revolution has provided us with resounding successes in
  different domains, such as image analysis. Despite initial claims to the contrary,
  however, the last years showed a dire need to understand and describe fundamental
  aspects of modern machine learning models. In this context, algebra, geometry, and
  topology offer a veritable cornucopia of different methods, ranging from the description
  of the boundary of neural network architectures to the development of more expressive
  models for graph learning, for example. There are few cross-pollination efforts
  between the machine learning community and the mathematical community at large.
  The papers in this collection represent two such efforts; all of them have been
  originally submitted to either the ICML Workshop on Topology, Algebra, and Geometry
  in Machine Learning or to the ICLR Workshop on Geometrical and Topological Representation
  Learning. We hope that this collection demonstrates to the reader the benefits of
  a more fundamental perspective on machine learning, and we hope that this will constitute
  the first of many such collections.
