title: Fiber Bundle Morphisms as a Framework for Modeling Many-to-Many Maps
abstract: 'While it is not generally reflected in the ‘nice’ datasets used for benchmarking
  machine learning algorithms, the real-world is full of processes that would be best
  described as many-to-many. That is, a single input can potentially yield many different
  outputs (whether due to noise, imperfect measurement, or intrinsic stochasticity
  in the process) and many different inputs can yield the same output (that is, the
  map is not injective). For example, imagine a sentiment analysis task where, due
  to linguistic ambiguity, a single statement can have a range of different sentiment
  interpretations while at the same time many distinct statements can represent the
  same sentiment. When modeling such a multivalued function $f: X \rightarrow Y$,
  it is frequently useful to be able to model the distribution on $f(x)$ for specific
  input $x$ as well as the distribution on fiber $f^{-1}(y)$ for specific output $y$.
  Such an analysis helps the user (i) better understand the variance intrinsic to
  the process they are studying and (ii) understand the range of specific input $x$
  that can be used to achieve output $y$. Following existing work which used a fiber
  bundle framework to better model many-to-one processes, we describe how morphisms
  of fiber bundles provide a template for building models which naturally capture
  the structure of many-to-many processes.'
