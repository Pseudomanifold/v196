title: " A Geometrical Approach to Finding Difficult Examples in Language "
abstract: " A growing body of evidence has suggested that metrics like accuracy overestimate
  the classifier’s generalization ability. Several state of the art Natural Language
  Processing (NLP) classifiers like BERT and LSTM rely on superficial cue words (e.g.,
  if a movie review has the word “romantic”, the review tends to be positive), or
  unnecessary words (e.g., learning a proper noun to classify a movie as positive
  or negative). One approach to test NLP classifiers for such fragilities is analogous
  to how teachers discover gaps in a student’s understanding: by finding problems
  where small perturbations confuse the student. While several perturbation strategies
  like contrast sets or random word substitutions have been proposed, they are typically
  based on heuristics and/or require expensive human involvement. In this work, using
  tools from information geometry, we propose a principled way to quantify the fragility
  of an example for an NLP classifier. By discovering such fragile examples for several
  state of the art NLP models like BERT, LSTM, and CNN, we demonstrate their susceptibility
  to meaningless perturbations like noun/synonym substitution, causing their accuracy
  to drop down to 20 percent in some cases. Our approach is simple, architecture agnostic
  and can be used to study the fragilities of text classification models.  "
