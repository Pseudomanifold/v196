title: A Simple and Universal Rotation Equivariant Point-Cloud Network
abstract: " Equivariance to permutations and rigid motions is an important inductive
  bias for various 3D learning problems. Recently it has been shown that the equivariant
  Tensor Field Network architecture is universal- it can approximate any equivariant
  function. In this paper we suggest a much simpler architecture, prove that it enjoys
  the same universality guarantees and evaluate its performance on Modelnet40."
