title: The Shape of Words - topological structure in natural language data
abstract: This paper presents a novel method, based on the ideas from algebraic topology,
  for the analysis of raw natural language text. The paper introduces the notion of
  a word manifold - a simplicial complex, whose topology encodes grammatical structure
  expressed by the corpus. Results of experiments with a variety of natural and synthetic
  languages are presented, showing that the homotopy type of the word manifold is
  influenced by linguistic structure. The analysis includes a new approach to the
  Voynich Manuscript - an unsolved puzzle in corpus linguistics. In contrast to existing
  topological data analysis approaches, we do not rely on the apparatus of persistent
  homology. Instead, we develop a method of generating topological structure directly
  from strings of words.
