title: Graph Convolutional Networks from the Perspective of Sheaves and the Neural
  Tangent Kernel
abstract: 'Graph convolutional networks are a popular class of deep neural network
  algorithms which have shown success in a number of relational learning tasks. Despite
  their success, graph convolutional networks exhibit a number of peculiar features,
  including a bias towards learning oversmoothed and homophilic functions, which are
  not easily diagnosed due to the complex nature of these algorithms. We propose to
  bridge this gap in understanding by studying the neural tangent kernel of sheaf
  convolutional networks–a topological generalization of graph convolutional networks.
  To this end, we derive a parameterization of the neural tangent kernel for sheaf
  convolutional networks which separates the function into two parts: one driven by
  a forward diffusion process determined by the graph, and the other determined by
  the composite effect of nodes’ activations on the output layer. This geometrically-focused
  derivation produces a number of immediate insights which we discuss in detail.'
