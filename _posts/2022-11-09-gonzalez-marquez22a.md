title: Two-dimensional visualization of large document libraries using t-SNE
abstract: We benchmarked different approaches for creating 2D visualizations of large
  document libraries, using the {MEDLINE} ({PubMed}) database of the entire biomedical
  literature as a use case (19 million scientific papers). Our optimal pipeline is
  based on log-scaled {TF-IDF} representation of the abstract text, {SVD} preprocessing,
  and {t-SNE} with uniform affinities, early exaggeration annealing, and extended
  optimization. The resulting embedding distorts local neighborhoods but shows meaningful
  organization and rich structure on the level of narrow academic fields.
