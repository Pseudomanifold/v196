title: Riemannian CUR Decompositions for Robust Principal Component Analysis
abstract: Robust Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has received massive attention
  in recent years. It aims to recover a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix from their
  sum. This paper proposes a novel nonconvex Robust PCA algorithm, coined Riemannian
  CUR (RieCUR), which utilizes the ideas of Riemannian optimization and robust CUR
  decompositions. This algorithm has the same computational complexity as Iterated
  Robust CUR, which is currently state-of-the-art, but is more robust to outliers.
  RieCUR is also able to tolerate a significant amount of outliers, and is comparable
  to Accelerated Alternating Projections, which has high outlier tolerance but worse
  computational complexity than the proposed method. Thus, the proposed algorithm
  achieves state-of-the-art performance on Robust PCA both in terms of computational
  complexity and outlier tolerance.
