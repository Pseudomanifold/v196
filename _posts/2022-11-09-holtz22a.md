title: Evaluating Disentanglement in Generative Models Without Knowledge of Latent
  Factors
abstract: 'Probabilistic generative models provide a flexible and systematic framework
  for learning the underlying geometry of data. However, model selection in this setting
  is challenging, particularly when selecting for ill-defined qualities such as disentanglement
  or interpretability. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a method for
  ranking generative models based on the training dynamics exhibited during learning.
  Inspired by recent theoretical characterizations of disentanglement, our method
  does not require supervision of the underlying latent factors. We evaluate our approach
  by demonstrating the need for disentanglement metrics which do not require labelsâ€”the
  underlying generative factors. We additionally demonstrate that our approach correlates
  with baseline supervised methods for evaluating disentanglement. Finally, we show
  that our method can be used as an unsupervised indicator for downstream performance
  on reinforcement learning and fairness-classification problems. '
