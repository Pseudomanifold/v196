title: Multiresolution Matrix Factorization and Wavelet Networks on Graphs
abstract: Multiresolution Matrix Factorization (MMF) is unusual amongst fast matrix
  factorization algorithms in that it does not make a low rank assumption. This makes
  MMF especially well suited to modeling certain types of graphs with complex multiscale
  or hierarchical structure. While MMF promises to yield a useful wavelet basis, finding
  the factorization itself is hard, and existing greedy methods tend to be brittle.
  In this paper, we propose a "learnable" version of MMF that carefully optimizes
  the factorization with a combination of reinforcement learning and Stiefel manifold
  optimization through backpropagating errors. We show that the resulting wavelet
  basis far outperforms prior MMF algorithms and provides the first version of this
  type of factorization that can be robustly deployed on standard learning tasks.
  Furthermore, we construct the wavelet neural networks (WNNs) learning graphs on
  the spectral domain with the wavelet basis produced by our MMF learning algorithm.
  Our wavelet networks are competitive against other state-of-the-art methods in molecular
  graphs classification and node classification on citation graphs. Our complete paper
  with the Appendix and more experiments is publicly available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01940.pdf.
  We release our implementation at https://github.com/risilab/Learnable_MMF/.
