title: Random Filters for Enriching the Discriminatory power of Topological Representations
abstract: Topological representations of data are inherently coarse summaries which
  endows them with certain desirable properties like stability but also potentially
  inhibits their discriminatory power relative to fine-scale learned features. In
  this work we present a novel framework for enriching the discriminatory power of
  topological representations based on random filters and capturing “interferencetopology”
  rather than direct topology. We show that our random filters outperform previously
  explored structured image filters while requiring orders of magnitude less computational
  time. The approach is demonstrated on the MNIST dataset but is broadly applicable
  across data sets and modalities. This work is concluded with a discussion of the
  mathematical intuition underlying the approach and identification of future directions
  to enable deeper understanding and theoretical results.
