title: 'TopTemp: Parsing Precipitate Structure from Temper Topology'
abstract: Technological advances are in part enabled by the development of novel manufacturing
  processes that give rise to new materials or material property improvements. Development
  and evaluation of new manufacturing methodologies is labor-, time-, and resource-intensive
  expensive due to complex, poorly defined relationships between advanced manufacturing
  process parameters and the resulting microstructures. In this work, we present a
  topological representation of temper (heat-treatment) dependent material micro-structure,
  as captured by scanning electron microscopy, called TopTemp. We show that this topological
  representation is able to support temper classification of microstructures in a
  data limited setting, generalizes well to previously unseen samples, is robust to
  image perturbations, and captures domain interpretable features. The presented work
  outperforms conventional deep learning baselines and is a first step towards improving
  understanding of process parameters and resulting material properties.
