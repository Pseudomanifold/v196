title: Rethinking Persistent Homology For Visual Recognition
abstract: 'Persistent topological properties of an image serve as an additional descriptor
  providing an insight that might not be discovered by traditional neural networks.
  The existing research in this area focuses primarily on efficiently integrating
  topological properties of the data in the learning process in order to enhance the
  performance. However, there is no existing study to demonstrate all possible scenarios
  where introducing topological properties can boost or harm the performance. This
  paper performs a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of topological properties
  for image classification in various training scenarios, defined by: the number of
  training samples, the complexity of the training data and the complexity of the
  backbone network. We identify the scenarios that benefit the most from topological
  features, e.g., training simple networks on small datasets. Additionally, we discuss
  the problem of topological consistency of the datasets which is one of the major
  bottlenecks for using topological features for classification. We further demonstrate
  how the topological inconsistency can harm the performance for certain scenarios.'
