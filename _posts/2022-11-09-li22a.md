title: Geodesic Properties of a Generalized Wasserstein Embedding for Time Series
  Aanalysis
abstract: 'Transport-based metrics and related embeddings (transforms) have recently
  been used to model signal classes where nonlinear structures or variations are present.
  In this paper, we study the geodesic properties of time series data with a generalized
  Wasserstein metric and the geometry related to their signed cumulative distribution
  transforms in the embedding space. Moreover, we show how understanding such geometric
  characteristics can provide added interpretability to certain time series classifiers,
  and be an inspiration for more robust classifiers. The appendix can be found at
