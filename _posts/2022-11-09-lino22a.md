title: 'REMuS-GNN: A Rotation-Equivariant Model for Simulating Continuum Dynamics'
abstract: Numerical simulation is an essential tool in many areas of science and engineering,
  but its performance often limits application in practice or when used to explore
  large parameter spaces. On the other hand, surrogate deep learning models, while
  accelerating simulations, often exhibit poor accuracy and ability to generalise.
  In order to improve these two factors, we introduce REMuS-GNN, a rotation-equivariant
  multi-scale model for simulating continuum dynamical systems encompassing a range
  of length scales. REMuS-GNN is designed to predict an output vector field from an
  input vector field on a physical domain discretised into an unstructured set of
  nodes. Equivariance to rotations of the domain is a desirable inductive bias that
  allows the network to learn the underlying physics more efficiently, leading to
  improved accuracy and generalisation compared with similar architectures that lack
  such symmetry. We demonstrate and evaluate this method on the incompressible flow
  around elliptical cylinders.
