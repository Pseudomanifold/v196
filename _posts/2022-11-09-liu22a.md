title: Persistent tor-algebra based stacking ensemble learning (PTA-SEL) for protein-protein
  binding affinity prediction
abstract: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play crucial roles in almost all biological
  processes. Recently, data-driven machine learning models have shown great power
  in the analysis of PPIs. However, efficient molecular representation and featurization
  are still key issues that hinder the performance of learning models. Here, we propose
  persistent Tor-algebra (PTA), PTA-based molecular characterization and featurization,
  and PTA-based stacking ensemble learning (PTA-SEL) for PPI binding affinity prediction,
  for the first time. More specifically, the Vietoris-Rips complex is used to characterize
  the PPI structure and its persistent Tor-algebra is computed to form the molecular
  descriptors. These descriptors then are fed into our stacking model to make the
  prediction. We systematically test our model on the two most commonly used datasets,
  i.e., SKEMPI and AB-Bind. It has been found that our model outperforms all the existing
  models as far as we know, which demonstrates the great power of our model.
