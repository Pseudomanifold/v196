title: Deoscillated Adaptive Graph Collaborative Filtering
abstract: 'Collaborative Filtering (CF) signals are crucial for a Recommender System (RS)
  model to learn user and item embeddings. High-order information can alleviate the
  cold-start issue of CF-based methods, which is modeled through propagating the information
  over the user-item bipartite graph. Recent Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propose
  to stack multiple aggregation layers to propagate high-order signals.  However,
  there are three challenges, the oscillation problem, varying locality of bipartite
  graphs, and the fixed propagation pattern, which spoil the ability of the multi-layer
  structure to propagate information. In this paper, we theoretically prove the existence
  and boundary of the oscillation problem, and empirically study the varying locality
  and layer-fixed propagation problems. We propose a new RS model, named as Deoscillated
  adaptive Graph Collaborative Filtering (DGCF), which is constituted by stacking
  multiple CHP layers and LA layers. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world
  datasets to verify the effectiveness of DGCF. Detailed analyses indicate that DGCF
  solves oscillation problems, adaptively learns local factors, and has layer-wise
  propagation patterns. '
