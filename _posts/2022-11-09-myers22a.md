title: 'ICLR 2022 Challenge for Computational Geometry & Topology: Design and Results'
abstract: This paper presents the computational challenge on differential geometry
  and topology that was hosted within the ICLR 2022 workshop “Geometric and Topo-
  logical Representation Learning”. The competition asked participants to provide
  implementations of machine learning algorithms on manifolds that would respect the
  API of the open-source software Geomstats (manifold part) and Scikit-Learn (machine
  learning part) or PyTorch. The challenge attracted seven teams in its two month
  duration. This paper describes the design of the challenge and summarizes its main
  findings.
