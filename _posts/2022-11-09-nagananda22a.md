title: Robust $L_p$-Norm Linear Discriminant Analysis with Proxy Matrix Optimization
abstract: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is an established supervised dimensionality
  reduction method that is traditionally based on the ${L}_2$-norm. However, the standard
  ${L}_2$-norm LDA is susceptible to outliers in the data that often contribute to
  a drop in accuracy. Using the ${L}_1$ or fractional $p$-norms makes LDA more robust
  to outliers, but it is a harder problem to solve due to the nature of the corresponding
  objective functions. In this paper, we leverage the orthogonal constraint of the
  Grassmann manifold to iteratively obtain the optimal projection matrix for the data
  in a lower dimensional space. Instead of optimizing the matrix directly on the manifold,
  we use the proxy matrix optimization (PMO) method, utilizing an auxiliary matrix
  in ambient space that is retracted to the closest location on the manifold along
  the loss minimizing geodesic. The ${L}_p$-LDA-PMO learning is based on backpropagation,
  which allows easy integration in a neural network and flexibility to change the
  value of the $p$-norm. Our experiments on synthetic and real data show that using
  fractional $p$-norms for LDA leads to an improvement in accuracy compared to the
  traditional ${L}_2$-based LDA.
