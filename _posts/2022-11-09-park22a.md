title: 'The PWLR graph representation: A Persistent Weisfeiler-Lehman scheme with
  Random Walks for graph classification'
abstract: 'This paper presents the Persistent Weisfeiler-Lehman Random walk scheme
  (abbreviated as PWLR) for graph representations, a novel mathematical framework
  which produces a collection of explainable low-dimensional representations of graphs
  with discrete and continuous node features. The proposed scheme effectively incorporates
  normalized Weisfeiler-Lehman procedure, random walks on graphs, and persistent homology.
  We thereby integrate three distinct properties of graphs, which are local topological
  features, node degrees, and global topological invariants, while preserving stability
  from graph perturbations. This generalizes many variants of Weisfeiler-Lehman procedures,
  which are primarily used to embed graphs with discrete node labels. Empirical results
  suggest that these representations can be efficiently utilized to produce comparable
  results to state-of-the-art techniques in classifying graphs with discrete node
  labels, and enhanced performances in classifying those with continuous node features. '
