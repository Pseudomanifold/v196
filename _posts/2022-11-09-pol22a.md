title: " Stochastic Parallelizable Eigengap Dilation for Large Graph Clustering  "
abstract: " Large graphs commonly appear in social networks, knowledge graphs, recommender
  systems, life sciences, and decision making problems. Summarizing large graphs by
  their high level properties is helpful in solving problems in these settings. In
  spectral clustering, we aim to identify clusters of nodes where most edges fall
  within clusters and only few edges fall between clusters. This task is important
  for many downstream applications and exploratory analysis. A core step of spectral
  clustering is performing an eigendecomposition of the corresponding graph Laplacian
  matrix (or equivalently, a singular value decomposition, SVD, of the incidence matrix).
  The convergence of iterative singular value decomposition approaches depends on
  the eigengaps of the spectrum of the given matrix, i.e., the difference between
  consecutive eigenvalues. For a graph Laplacian corresponding to a well-clustered
  graph, the eigenvalues will be non-negative but very small (much less than 1) slowing
  convergence. This paper introduces a parallelizable approach to dilating the spectrum
  in order to accelerate SVD solvers and in turn, spectral clustering. This is accomplished
  via polynomial approximations to matrix operations that favorably transform the
  spectrum of a matrix without changing its eigenvectors. Experiments demonstrate
  that this approach significantly accelerates convergence, and we explain how this
  transformation can be parallelized and stochastically approximated to scale with
  available compute. "
