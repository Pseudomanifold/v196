title: 'CubeRep: Learning Relations Between Different Views of Data   '
abstract: Multi-view learning tasks typically seek an aggregate synthesis of multiple
  views or perspectives of a single data set. The current approach assumes that there
  is an ambient space $X$ in which the views are images of $X$ under certain functions
  and attempts to learn these functions via a neural network. Unfortunately, such
  an approach neglects to consider the geometry of the ambient space. Hierarchically
  hyperbolic spaces (HHSes) do, however, provide a natural multi-view arrangement
  of data; they provide geometric tools for the assembly of different views of a single
  data set into a coherent global space, a \emph{CAT(0) cube complex}. In this work,
  we provide the first step toward theoretically justifiable methods for learning
  embeddings of multi-view data sets into CAT(0) cube complexes. We present an algorithm
  which, given a finite set of finite metric spaces (views) on a finite set of points
  (the objects), produces the key components of an HHS structure. From this structure,
  we can produce a \emph{CAT(0) cube complex} that encodes the hyperbolic geometry
  in the data while simultaneously allowing for Euclidean features given by the detected
  relations among the views.
