title: 'RipsNet: a general architecture for fast and robust estimation of the persistent
  homology of point clouds'
abstract: 'The use of topological descriptors in modern machine learning applications,
  such as persistence diagrams (PDs) arising from Topological Data Analysis (TDA),
  has shown great potential in various domains. However, their practical use in applications
  is often hindered by two major limitations: the computational complexity required
  to compute such descriptors exactly, and their sensitivity to even low-level proportions
  of outliers. In this work, we propose to bypass these two burdens in a data-driven
  setting by entrusting the estimation of (vectorization of) PDs built on top of point
  clouds to a neural network architecture that we call RipsNet. Once trained on a
  given data set, RipsNet can estimate topological descriptors on test data very efficiently
  with generalization capacity. Furthermore, we prove that RipsNet is robust to input
  perturbations in terms of the 1-Wasserstein distance, a major improvement over the
  standard computation of PDs that only enjoys Hausdorff stability, yielding RipsNet
  to substantially outperform exactly-computed PDs in noisy settings. We showcase
  the use of RipsNet on both synthetic and real-world data. Our implementation will
  be made freely and publicly available as part of the open-source library Gudhi.'
