title: Score Matching for Truncated Density Estimation on a Manifold
abstract: When observations are truncated, we are limited to an incomplete picture
  of our dataset. Recent methods deal with truncated density estimation problems by
  turning to score matching, where the access to the intractable normalising constant
  is not required. We present a novel extension to truncated score matching for a
  Riemannian manifold. Applications are presented for the von Mises-Fisher and Kent
  distributions on a two dimensional sphere in R3, as well as a realworld application
  of extreme storm observations in the USA. In simulated data experiments, our score
  matching estimator is able to approximate the true parameter values with a low estimation
  error and shows improvements over a maximum likelihood estimator.
