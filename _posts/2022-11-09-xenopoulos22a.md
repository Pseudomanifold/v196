title: 'GALE: Globally Assessing Local Explanations'
abstract: " Local explainability methods – those which seek to generate an explanation
  for each prediction – are increasingly prevalent. However, results from different
  local explainability methods are difficult to compare since they may be parameter-dependant,
  unstable due to sampling variability, or in various scales and dimensions. We propose
  GALE, a topology-based framework to extract a simplified representation from a set
  of local explanations. GALE models the relationship between the explanation space
  and model predictions to generate a topological skeleton, which we use to compare
  local explanation outputs. We demonstrate that GALE can not only reliably identify
  differences between explainability techniques but also provides stable representations.
  Then, we show how our framework can be used to identify appropriate parameters for
  local explainability methods. Our framework is simple, does not require complex
  optimizations, and can be broadly applied to most local explanation methods. "
