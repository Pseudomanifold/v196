title: APPROXIMATE EQUIVARIANCE SO(3) NEEDLET CONVOLUTION
abstract: This paper develops a rotation-invariant needlet convolution for rotation
  group SO(3) to distill multiscale information of spherical signals. The spherical
  needlet transform is generalized from $\sS^2$ onto the SO(3) group, which decomposes
  a spherical signal to approximate and detailed spectral coefficients by a set of
  tight framelet operators. The spherical signal during the decomposition and reconstruction
  achieves rotation invariance.  Based on needlet transforms, we form a Needlet approximate
  Equivariance Spherical CNN (NES) with multiple SO(3) needlet convolutional layers.
  The network establishes a powerful tool to extract geometric-invariant features
  of spherical signals.  The model allows sufficient network scalability with multi-resolution
  representation. A robust signal embedding is learned with wavelet shrinkage activation
  function, which filters out redundant high-pass representation while maintaining
  approximate rotation invariance. The NES achieves state-of-the-art performance for
  quantum chemistry regression and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) delensing reconstruction,
  which shows great potential for solving scientific challenges with high-resolution
  and multi-scale spherical signal representation.
